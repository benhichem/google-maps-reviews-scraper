    reviewText: "An exponential decline in the quality of products and services and an exponential increase in prices. I have been a  customer at this caf√© since the beginning and today I understood that it is over: a record waiting time, a waiter who comes and goes without understanding what I want and what he has and finally the icing on the cake is a product that is not worthy of what we expect from the place. Once again we see that it is difficult to stay the course for many of our businesses and it is sad",
